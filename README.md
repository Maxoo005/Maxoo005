# Hi, I'm Max! 🚀

### 🎓 Computer Science Student @ Wrocław University of Science and Technology (PWr)
**Ambitious Developer | Creative Problem Solver | Tech Enthusiast**

I don't believe in "impossible". I believe in well-optimized code and persistent debugging. As a student of **IT & Systems Engineering**, I combine academic theory with a product-focused mindset to build solutions that actually matter.

### 🧠 Technical Mindset
- **"No block is too high":** I treat every technical hurdle as a challenge to overcome. My creativity allows me to find non-obvious solutions where others see a dead end.
- **Continuous Growth:** Completed intensive technical workshops organized by the **Solvro** academic community in:
  - 📱 **Mobile Development** (Dart/Flutter focus)
  - 🎨 **Frontend Engineering** (React & modern JS)
  - 🤖 **Machine Learning** (Data-driven logic)
